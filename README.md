# Node.js: Professional README Generator

## Description
When creating an open source project on GitHub, itâ€™s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions&mdash;this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project. 

You can quickly and easily generate a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time working on the project.

## Installation
In your terminal go to the readme-generator folder
Initiate npm by typing 'npm init' to command line
Install inquirer by typing 'npm install inquirer' to command line 

## Usage
The application will be invoked by using the following command:
node index.js
Answer all the prompts and your README.md file will be created in dist folder
